Design Philosophy

 The tightrope: Too prescriptive → all models produce similar strategies. Too vague → garbage strategies that waste 90 days.

 Solution: Provide principles + anti-patterns + edge examples, NOT templates or formulas.

 Structure: Six Components

 Component 1: Edge Articulation Framework

 The #1 problem with retail/AI strategies: no clear edge. Force articulation upfront.

 ## 1. Edge Articulation (MANDATORY)

 Your strategy must exploit a **structural market inefficiency**. Generic "buy winners" or "follow momentum" is NOT an edge—it's a description of what you'll do.

 ### Edge Framework: Answer These 3 Questions

 **Q1: What is the inefficiency you're exploiting?**

 Examples of VALID edges:
 - **Volatility mispricing:** Options markets systematically overprice near-term volatility in low-VIX regimes; selling volatility earns premium decay
 - **Momentum persistence:** Stocks with 6-12 month outperformance continue for 3-6 more months due to institutional herding and under-reaction
 - **Defensive rotation lag:** During volatility spikes, capital rotates to bonds/gold with 2-5 day delay; preemptive rotation captures early move
 - **Sector mean reversion:** Extreme sector underperformance (>10% vs SPY over 90d) reverts 60% of the time within 180 days as value buyers step in

 Examples of INVALID (too generic):
 - ❌ "Buy stocks that go up" (no structural reason)
 - ❌ "Diversify across assets" (not an edge, just risk management)
 - ❌ "Follow trends" (what trend? why does it persist?)

 **Q2: Why does this inefficiency exist?**

 Valid reasons:
 - Behavioral (investors systematically over/under-react to X)
 - Structural (institutional constraints force selling at Y)
 - Informational (data Z is underutilized by market)
 - Risk premium (exposure to rare event W is under-compensated)

 **Q3: Why is this edge exploitable NOW (at cohort launch)?**

 - Market regime alignment (current volatility/trend/dispersion favors this edge)
 - Recent event setup (sector dislocation, sentiment extreme)
 - Catalyst timing (earnings season, Fed decision, seasonal pattern)

 ### Edge Scorecard

 Before finalizing your strategy, rate your edge on these dimensions (1-5 scale):

 | Dimension | 1 (Weak) | 5 (Strong) | Your Score |
 |-----------|----------|------------|------------|
 | **Specificity** | "Buy winners" | "Buy 3M momentum leaders in low-VIX regimes" | |
 | **Structural basis** | "Feels right" | "Documented in academic literature + validated in backtest" | |
 | **Regime alignment** | "Works sometimes" | "Current market conditions ideal for this edge" | |
 | **Differentiation** | "Everyone does this" | "Underutilized or novel combination" | |
 | **Failure mode clarity** | "Not sure what breaks it" | "Enumerated 3+ specific conditions that kill edge" | |
 | **Mental model coherence** | "Haven't classified strategy type" | "Clear classification across regime/factor/edge/archetype with coherent story" | |

 **Minimum threshold:** Score ≥3 on all dimensions. If any dimension scores ≤2, reconsider this strategy.

 **Before proceeding:** Complete the Mental Models Classification (Component 2 below) to ensure your edge is grounded in sound strategic reasoning.

 Component 2: Mental Models Classification

 Force strategic self-awareness through systematic classification.

 ## 2. Mental Models Classification (MANDATORY)

 Before committing to your strategy, classify it across five fundamental dimensions. This forces you to understand WHAT TYPE of bet you're making, not just WHAT you're buying.

 ### Mental Model 1: Regime Classification

 **Framework:**
 Markets move through different regimes based on two dimensions: **trend** (bull/bear/sideways) and **volatility** (high/low). Different strategies have natural habitats - they thrive in some regimes and struggle in others.

 - **Bull + Low Vol**: Momentum and carry strategies tend to work; fear is low, trends persist
 - **Bull + High Vol**: Flight to quality; defensive rotation, concentrated conviction plays
 - **Bear + High Vol**: Preservation mode; mean reversion often fails, directional shorts or hedges
 - **Bear + Low Vol**: Range-bound; mean reversion, value strategies can work
 - **Sideways + Low Vol**: Factor rotation, market-neutral, stat arb

 These aren't rules - they're starting points for reasoning.

 **Your Task:**
 1. **What regime are we in NOW (at cohort start)?** Provide evidence: VIX level, trend indicators, market breadth, recent moves
 2. **What regime is your strategy designed for?** Be specific - is it multi-regime or optimized for current conditions?
 3. **If the regime shifts, what happens to your strategy?** Example: "If we move from Bull+Low Vol to Bull+High Vol, my momentum strategy likely continues but with higher drawdowns"

 **Why This Matters:**
 Regime misalignment is a top failure mode. A mean-reversion strategy launched into a strong trend will bleed slowly. Making your regime assumptions explicit helps you (and evaluators) diagnose problems later.

 ---

 ### Mental Model 2: Factor Exposure

 **Framework:**
 Most equity strategies are bets on underlying **factors** - systematic sources of return that have been studied extensively. Understanding your factor exposure helps you predict behavior and identify risks.

 Common factors:
 - **Momentum**: Recent winners continue winning (3-12 month persistence)
 - **Value**: Cheap assets (low P/E, P/B) outperform over long periods
 - **Quality**: Profitable, stable companies with low debt
 - **Size**: Small caps vs large caps
 - **Low Volatility**: Defensive stocks outperform in risk-off periods
 - **Carry**: Earning yield/premium from holding positions (dividends, bond yield, volatility premium)

 Your strategy likely has exposure to one or more of these, even if you didn't design it that way.

 **Your Task:**
 1. **What factors is your strategy exposed to?** Be honest - if you're buying recent winners, that's momentum. If you're rotating to bonds during volatility spikes, that's low-volatility factor.
 2. **Is this exposure intentional or accidental?** Intentional: "I'm explicitly betting on momentum persistence." Accidental: "I thought this was unique but it's actually just small-cap value."
 3. **What's your edge within this factor?** If momentum works generally, why will YOUR momentum strategy work better than a standard momentum ETF? Timing? Selection? Combination with other factors?
 4. **When do these factors fail?** Momentum fails in reversals. Value fails in sustained growth regimes. Quality underperforms in risk-on rallies.

 **Why This Matters:**
 Many "unique" strategies are just repackaged factor bets. If you're claiming an edge, you need to articulate what you're doing beyond standard factor exposure. If you ARE making a factor bet, own it and explain why NOW is the time for that factor.

 ---

 ### Mental Model 3: Edge Type Classification

 **Framework:**
 Edges exist for reasons. Understanding WHY your edge exists helps predict when it will disappear.

 - **Behavioral edges**: Investors systematically over/under-react (recency bias, loss aversion, herding, anchoring)
 - **Structural edges**: Institutional constraints force suboptimal behavior (quarter-end rebalancing, fund flows, index reconstitution)
 - **Informational edges**: You're using data/signals the market hasn't fully incorporated (underutilized datasets, novel combinations)
 - **Risk premium edges**: You're accepting risk others avoid (volatility, illiquidity, tail risk, leverage)

 **Your Task:**
 1. **Which type of edge are you exploiting?** Be specific - "behavioral: investors overreact to earnings misses" or "structural: ETF rebalancing creates predictable flows"
 2. **Why hasn't this edge been arbitraged away?** If it's so obvious, why does it still work? (Common answers: requires patience, limits to arbitrage, keeps re-emerging, risk prevents full exploitation)
 3. **What would eliminate this edge?** Example: "If algorithmic trading starts front-running this signal, edge disappears" or "If volatility stays persistently high, fear premium normalizes"
 4. **Is this edge exploitable at scale?** Some edges work with $10M but break with $1B due to market impact or liquidity.

 **Why This Matters:**
 If you can't explain WHY your edge exists, you might be overfitting to noise. Edges rooted in durable behavioral biases or structural constraints are more likely to persist than edges based on spurious correlations.

 ---

 ### Mental Model 4: Portfolio Construction Logic

 **Framework:**
 Your edge tells you WHAT to buy. Portfolio construction tells you HOW MUCH and WITH WHAT ELSE. These are separate decisions with different logic.

 Key dimensions:
 - **Concentration vs Diversification**: Concentration magnifies edge but increases risk. Diversification reduces risk but dilutes edge. The right balance depends on conviction and time horizon.
 - **Correlation structure**: True diversification requires LOW correlation. Five assets with 0.9 correlation = false diversification.
 - **Position sizing**: Equal weight? Market cap? Volatility-adjusted? Conviction-weighted? Each choice has implications.
 - **Rebalancing logic**: Threshold-based (only rebalance when drift exceeds X%)? Time-based (monthly/quarterly)? Dynamic (rebalance based on signals)?

 **Your Task:**
 1. **Why this concentration level?** If >30% in single asset: what's your conviction? What's your pain threshold? If highly diversified: are you diluting your edge?
 2. **What's the correlation structure?** Check pairwise correlations of top holdings. If >0.7, you have concentrated exposure even if you hold many assets.
 3. **How did you choose position sizes?** Equal weight assumes equal conviction and equal risk. Is that true? If not, what's your weighting logic?
 4. **Why this rebalancing frequency?** Daily rebalancing is responsive but noisy. Quarterly is stable but slow. Match frequency to your edge's timescale.
 5. **What happens in a drawdown?** Will you average down (buy more)? Hold? Exit? Does your strategy have an explicit risk management rule?

 **Why This Matters:**
 Poor portfolio construction kills good edges. A solid momentum edge can fail if you're rebalancing too frequently (whipsawed by noise) or too infrequently (miss the turn). Concentration can amplify returns but also lead to catastrophic drawdowns if conviction was misplaced.

 ---

 ### Mental Model 5: Strategy Archetype

 **Framework:**
 Strategies can be classified by their fundamental approach to generating returns. Understanding your archetype helps predict behavior and identify natural failure modes.

 Common archetypes:
 - **Directional**: Betting on asset price direction (long equities, short bonds, sector rotation)
 - **Relative value**: Betting on relationships between assets (pairs trading, sector relative strength, curve trades)
 - **Carry**: Earning yield from holding positions (dividend stocks, bond yield, selling volatility)
 - **Momentum/Trend-following**: Riding established trends (breakouts, moving average crossovers)
 - **Mean reversion**: Betting on returns to average (oversold bounces, sector rotation from extremes)
 - **Volatility**: Trading realized or implied volatility (straddles, VIX trades, low-vol equity)
 - **Multi-strategy**: Combining multiple archetypes with different market exposures

 **Your Task:**
 1. **What archetype is your strategy?** Be honest - most strategies are combinations, but usually one archetype dominates.
 2. **What's the return source?** Directional: market beta. Carry: premium collection. Momentum: trend persistence. Mean reversion: cycles. Be explicit.
 3. **What's the natural failure mode for this archetype?**
    - Directional fails in reversals
    - Carry fails in crises (premium evaporates)
    - Momentum fails when trends break
    - Mean reversion fails in sustained trends
    - Volatility strategies fail in regime changes
 4. **Are you combining archetypes? Why?** If momentum + defensive rotation: explain the logic. Diversification? Regime adaptation? Hedging?

 **Why This Matters:**
 Each archetype has characteristic behavior and breaking points. If you don't know your archetype, you can't diagnose problems. "Why is my strategy failing?" requires knowing what type of strategy it is. Momentum strategies should fail differently than carry strategies.

 ---

 ### Integration Checkpoint

 **After classifying your strategy across all five models, answer:**

 1. **Do these classifications tell a coherent story?** Example: "Momentum factor + Bull/Low-Vol regime + Behavioral edge + Concentrated portfolio + Trend-following archetype" = internally consistent. If classifications conflict, revisit your logic.

 2. **Have you identified overlapping failure modes?** If your regime, factor, edge type, and archetype all break under the same conditions (e.g., "market reversal"), you have concentrated risk. Is this intentional?

 3. **Can you articulate your strategy in one sentence using this vocabulary?** Example: "A momentum-factor strategy exploiting behavioral under-reaction in bull/low-vol regimes through concentrated positions in tech leaders."

 **This isn't a formula - it's a thinking tool.** Use these models to pressure-test your reasoning and make implicit assumptions explicit.

 Component 3: Risk Management Principles

 Concrete guidance without prescribing exact parameters.

 ## 3. Risk Management (MANDATORY)

 ### Concentration Limits

 **Principle:** Diversification is not free—it dilutes edge. But concentration is fragile.

 **Guidance:**
 - **Single-asset max:** Up to 50% allocation is allowed (validation will flag >50%)
 - **Sector/industry concentration:** Allowed if justified by your edge
 - **Correlation check:** If top 3 holdings have pairwise correlation >0.8, you have false diversification

 **Concentrated strategies are acceptable when:**
 - You have high conviction in a specific asset, sector, or theme
 - Your edge explicitly requires concentration (e.g., "Tech momentum in AI boom")
 - Short time horizon (90 days) reduces concentration risk vs long-term portfolios
 - **Must justify in charter:** Why this concentration? What's your max loss tolerance? What breaks your thesis?

 **Example justifications:**
 - ✅ "45% NVDA allocation because thesis is AI infrastructure dominance; breaking point is -20% or competitor emergence"
 - ✅ "60% energy sector because oil supply shock creates 90-day tailwind; exit if WTI drops below $70"
 - ❌ "High allocation because backtest showed it worked" (no forward-looking justification)

 ### Drawdown Planning

 **Principle:** Max drawdown is the price of your edge. Define it upfront.

 **Framework:**
 1. **Expected max drawdown:** Given your strategy's volatility and holding period, what's a reasonable worst-case? (Rule of thumb: ~2x annualized volatility over 90 days)
 2. **Breaking point:** At what drawdown does your thesis break? (Not pain tolerance—when is edge invalidated?)
 3. **Benchmark comparison:** Are you willing to drawdown more than SPY to capture your edge?

 **Example:**
 - Strategy: Momentum tech concentration
 - Expected volatility: 25% annualized → ~12% drawdown over 90 days is plausible
 - Breaking point: -15% (thesis: momentum persists; if -15%, momentum broke)
 - Benchmark tolerance: Willing to exceed SPY drawdown by 5% to capture tech beta

 ### Rebalancing Frequency

 **Tradeoffs:**

 | Frequency | Pros | Cons | Best For |
 |-----------|------|------|----------|
 | **Daily** | Responsive to signals | High noise, potential overtrading | High-conviction technical signals |
 | **Weekly** | Balance responsiveness + noise | May miss fast moves | Tactical rotation strategies |
 | **Monthly** | Low trading costs, stable | Slow to adapt | Fundamental/valuation strategies |
 | **Threshold-based** | Only rebalance on signal | Can drift significantly | Mean reversion, regime change |

 **Validation check:** Does your rebalancing frequency match your edge's timescale?
 - Momentum (3-6 month): Monthly rebalancing reasonable
 - Volatility spike response: Weekly or threshold-based
 - Long-term value: Quarterly (but you only have 90 days!)

 ### Risk Parity Consideration

 **When to use:**
 - You have uncorrelated assets (stocks, bonds, gold, vol)
 - No strong directional conviction
 - Want stable risk-adjusted returns

 **When NOT to use:**
 - You have a directional edge (momentum, sector rotation)
 - Your assets are correlated (tech stocks + QQQ = false diversification)
 - Equal risk ≠ equal edge capture

 Component 4: Platform-Specific Wisdom (Composer Constraints)

 Practical guidance on working within Composer's limitations.

 ## 4. Composer Platform Mastery

 ### Cash Management

 **Constraint:** Cannot hold 100% cash in Composer.

 **Solutions:**
 - **Cash proxy:** BIL (1-3 month T-bills), SHV (short-term Treasuries)
 - **Defensive allocation:** AGG (aggregate bonds), TLT (long Treasuries)
 - **Risk-off basket:** 50% AGG + 30% GLD + 20% BIL

 **When to use cash proxy:**
 - Your strategy has "risk-off" mode (exit equities during drawdown)
 - Conditional logic: IF VIX > 30 THEN rotate to BIL

 ### Shorting Without Shorting

 **Constraint:** No direct short positions.

 **Solutions:**
 - **Inverse ETFs:** SH (inverse SPY), PSQ (inverse QQQ), TBF (inverse 20Y Treasuries)
 - **Hedge overlay:** 70% long QQQ + 30% SH = 40% net long with downside protection
 - **Pairs trade:** Long XLF (financials) + short TLT (inverse rate exposure)

 **WARNING:** Inverse ETFs have daily reset—NOT suitable for long holds. Use only for short-term tactical hedges (≤30 days).

 ### Leverage Without Leverage

 **Constraint:** No margin in Composer.

 **Solutions:**
 - **Leveraged ETFs:** UPRO (3x SPY), TQQQ (3x QQQ), TMF (3x TLT)
 - **Risk:** Daily compounding decay in sideways markets
 - **Use case:** High-conviction directional bet over short horizon

 **Validation question:** If you're using 3x leverage, can you articulate why 1x doesn't capture your edge?

 ### Conditional Logic Best Practices

 **Composer IF-THEN-ELSE guidance:**

 ✅ **Good conditionals (robust):**
 - Regime indicators: MA crossovers, VIX thresholds, yield curve slope
 - Relative strength: Asset A vs Asset B
 - Volatility breakouts: 20d vol > 90d vol

 ❌ **Bad conditionals (overfit):**
 - Hyper-specific: "17-day EMA crosses 83-day SMA" (why those numbers?)
 - Event-driven: "IF month == October" (calendar effects are weak/noisy)
 - Too many conditions: IF (A AND B AND C) THEN... (each AND gate reduces signal)

 **Simplicity test:** Can you explain your conditional to a non-technical investor in one sentence?

 ### Filters for Dynamic Selection

 **Use case:** "From these 10 tech stocks, select top 3 by 90-day momentum"

 **Guidance:**
 - **Minimum pool size:** ≥5 candidates (avoids overfitting to specific stocks)
 - **Selection criteria:** Momentum, value, volatility, or combination
 - **Rebalancing:** Monthly or quarterly to avoid churn

 **Example:**
 FILTER:
   POOL: [AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NVDA, AMD, AVGO, QCOM, INTC, CRM]
   SORT: 90-day cumulative return (descending)
   SELECT: Top 3
   WEIGHT: Equal
   REBALANCE: Monthly

 **Validation:** Run backtest—do top 3 change every month? If yes, you'll have high turnover + noise.

 Component 5: Anti-Patterns & Failure Modes

 Critical: Show what NOT to do.

 ## 5. Anti-Patterns (Learn from Common Failures)

 ### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Curve-Fitting Paradise

 **What it looks like:**
 - Backtest Sharpe ratio: 4.8
 - Perfect timing of COVID crash (March 2020)
 - Exactly 3 rebalances over 3 years
 - Suspiciously specific parameters (73-day SMA, RSI < 32.7)

 **Why it fails:**
 - Overfitted to historical noise
 - Will fail immediately in live trading
 - Validation filter will catch this (Sharpe > 5 red flag)

 **How to avoid:**
 - Use round numbers for parameters (50-day MA, not 47-day)
 - Test robustness: Does strategy work with 40-day and 60-day MA?
 - Simulate forward: Would this logic make sense without seeing the backtest?

 ### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Diversification Theater

 **What it looks like:**
 - "Diversified" portfolio: 30% QQQ + 20% TQQQ + 20% XLK + 15% MSFT + 15% AAPL
 - Claims "5 holdings = diversified"
 - Ignores correlation

 **Why it fails:**
 - All positions are correlated tech exposure (correlation >0.9)
 - In a tech selloff, entire portfolio moves together
 - Not diversification—it's concentration with extra steps

 **How to avoid:**
 - Check pairwise correlations (use 90-day rolling)
 - Diversification requires LOW correlation (<0.5)
 - Better: 40% QQQ + 30% TLT + 30% GLD (correlation <0.3)

 ### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Regime Misalignment

 **What it looks like:**
 - Launch date: Jan 2025 (VIX 24, bull market)
 - Strategy: "Buy beaten-down value stocks" (mean reversion)
 - Thesis: "Market overreacts to bad news"

 **Why it fails:**
 - Mean reversion works in range-bound, low-vol markets
 - Current regime: Trending + elevated vol = momentum works, mean reversion fails
 - Thesis-regime mismatch

 **How to avoid:**
 - Match strategy to current regime (from Layer 2 context)
 - If bull + high vol → momentum, breakout, or defensive rotation
 - If sideways + low vol → mean reversion, value, or range trading

 ### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: No Failure Modes

 **What it looks like:**
 - Charter: "This strategy will outperform in all market conditions"
 - No downside scenarios mentioned
 - No breaking points defined

 **Why it fails:**
 - Every edge has conditions where it breaks
 - Inability to articulate failure = don't understand your edge
 - Board meetings will reveal you can't diagnose problems

 **How to avoid:**
 - Enumerate ≥3 specific failure modes
 - Example: "This strategy fails if: (1) VIX drops below 12 for 30+ days (vol premium disappears), (2) Fed cuts rates aggressively (defensive assets rally, eroding short hedge), (3) Sector correlation spikes above 0.8 (diversification breaks)"

 Component 6: Evaluation Alignment

 Explicitly connect guidelines to scoring rubric.

 ## 6. How This Maps to Your Score (50% Process + 50% Quantitative)

 ### Process Quality (50% of total score)

 **Charter & Initial Strategy (20%):**
 - ✅ Edge articulation: Scored on specificity, structural basis, regime alignment (see Edge Scorecard)
 - ✅ Selection reasoning: Why this strategy vs your other 4 candidates? What tradeoffs did you optimize for?
 - ✅ Failure modes: ≥3 specific, falsifiable conditions + early warning signals

 **Board Meeting Decisions (30% total, 10% each):**
 - ✅ Quality of diagnosis: Do you cite evidence (holdings, returns, market changes)?
 - ✅ Reasoning quality: Is adjustment justified vs original thesis?
 - ✅ Consistency: Do you thrash between approaches, or evolve coherently?

 ### Quantitative Performance (50% of total score)

 **Sharpe Ratio vs Benchmarks (25%):**
 - You're ranked by percentile vs 6 benchmarks (SPY, QQQ, AGG, 60/40, Risk Parity, Random)
 - Beat 6/6 = 100th percentile (excellent)
 - Beat 3/6 = 50th percentile (mediocre)
 - **Implication:** You don't need absolute returns—you need relative outperformance

 **Max Drawdown Management (15%):**
 - Absolute penalty if <-50% (catastrophic)
 - Relative comparison to benchmarks (did you protect capital better?)
 - Charter alignment: Did strategy behave as predicted?

 **Consistency (10%):**
 - % of months with positive returns
 - Did strategy follow expected behavior from charter?
 - Low consistency + high returns = got lucky (process score will suffer)

 ### Strategic Guidance

 **To maximize score:**
 1. **Articulate edge clearly** (process points + sets up diagnosis quality)
 2. **Choose regime-aligned strategy** (increases Sharpe percentile rank)
 3. **Define failure modes upfront** (enables high-quality board meeting diagnosis)
 4. **Manage drawdown explicitly** (protects 15% of quantitative score)
 5. **Stay consistent with thesis** (process points + consistency metric)

 **Don't optimize for:**
 - Absolute returns (noisy over 90 days)
 - Sharpe ratio in isolation (relative rank matters)
 - Complexity (simple + well-reasoned beats complex + opaque)

 # INVESTING STRATEGY GUIDELINES

 ## Overview

 These guidelines help you create a robust 90-day trading strategy. They are NOT a template—every strategy should be different based on your edge and market context.

 **Your goal:** Create ONE strategy (from 5 candidates) that:
 1. Exploits a clear structural inefficiency (edge)
 2. Is aligned with current market regime
 3. Manages risk explicitly
 4. Can be executed on Composer platform
 5. Will be evaluated 50% on process (your reasoning) + 50% on results (vs benchmarks)

 ## 7. Example Strategies (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)

 **⚠️ WARNING: These are EXAMPLES of the framework, NOT templates to copy. Copying these defeats the purpose of the evaluation. They are dated and designed for past market conditions.**

 ### Example 1: Tech Momentum Strategy (Q4 2023 Context)

 **Edge:** Momentum persistence in mega-cap tech during AI investment boom. Stocks with 6-month outperformance continue 3+ months due to institutional capital rotation and narrative strength.

 **Why Now (Q4 2023):** AI infrastructure spending accelerating, big tech earnings beating, VIX low (12-15 range) supports momentum strategies.

 **Holdings:**
 - 70% rotation: Top 3 from [NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, META, AAPL] by 90-day momentum
 - 30% TLT (defensive hedge if momentum breaks)
 - IF VIX > 25 THEN rotate to 60% TLT, 40% GLD

 **Failure Modes:**
 1. VIX spikes above 25 for >10 days (momentum reverses)
 2. Fed hawkish surprise (rate hikes kill tech multiples)
 3. Top 3 stocks become correlated >0.9 (single-stock risk)

 **Charter Excerpt:** "This strategy assumes AI narrative persists through Q4 2023 and volatility remains low. If VIX regime changes or tech correlation spikes, defensive rotation protects capital. Expected drawdown: 8-12%. Breaking point: -15%."

 ---

 ### Example 2: Defensive Rotation Strategy (Q1 2023 Context)

 **Edge:** During volatility spikes, capital rotates to bonds/gold with 2-5 day lag. Preemptive rotation captures the early move before broad market capitulation.

 **Why Now (Q1 2023):** Banking crisis fears (SVB collapse), Fed tightening cycle, elevated vol (VIX 20-28). Defensive assets outperform during uncertainty.

 **Holdings:**
 - Base: 40% AGG (bonds), 30% GLD (gold), 30% BIL (cash proxy)
 - IF SPY > 50-day MA AND VIX < 18 THEN 70% QQQ, 30% TLT
 - Rebalance weekly (responsive to regime changes)

 **Failure Modes:**
 1. Rapid V-shaped recovery (miss upside by being defensive)
 2. VIX stays elevated but equities rally anyway (2020-style)
 3. Bonds and stocks both fall (rising real rates)

 **Charter Excerpt:** "This strategy optimizes for capital preservation in uncertain Q1 2023 environment. Willing to underperform in strong rallies to avoid drawdowns. Expected: 5-8% annualized return, max drawdown <-8%. If regime shifts to sustained low-vol bull, strategy will lag."

 ---

 **Key Takeaways from Examples:**
 - Both clearly articulate edge + why now + failure modes
 - Different styles (momentum vs defensive) show framework flexibility
 - Concentrated holdings justified by thesis
 - Conditional logic matches timescale of edge
 - Failure modes are specific and falsifiable

 **Do NOT copy these.** Your strategy must be designed for YOUR cohort's market context.
